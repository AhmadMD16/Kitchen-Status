# Kitchen Status

This device checks if a room is occupied or not based on the light that is in that specific room and then communicates the information through WIFI to a web server that has been set up on a ESP8266 board.

## Description
Living in a student dormitory can be challenging sometimes, especially when you have to share some common areas such as the kitchen with other students. It can sometimes get awkward when you accidentally open the kitchen door to find out that it’s already in use by some other student making their third bowl of instant noodles and to be honest, I’ve had enough. That’s why I created this simple, yet revolutionary device that solved this problem for me.

The components used for this build are:

* ESP8266
* Photoresistor
* Resistor
